If you want to try this project you have to initialize using repo
the dependencies

```
$ mkdir pov && cd pov
$ repo init -u http://github.com/gipi/pov-project.git -b manifest
$ repo sync
```

Now you have some directory:

 - ``src`` containing the source code
 - ``build`` containing the library and build system for AVR

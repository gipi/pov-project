===============================

The project's aim is to develop a device that display, using the principles
of the **persistence of view**, a pattern on a spinning wheel (a bicycle one).

It utilizes an ``ATMega32U4`` as central processing unit and an accelerometer as
extenal sensor to calibrate internally the position and velocity of the device.

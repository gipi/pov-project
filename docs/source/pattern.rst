Pattern
=======

The main aim of this device is to display some pattern during the
wheel rotation, in this section we want to calculate some essential
parameters needed to accomplish that.

We have

 - :math:`f_R` the frequency of rotation of the wheel, we suppose :math:`1\leq f_R\leq 100`
 - :math:`N` the number of the *points* available on the wheel
 - :math:`f_P` the updating frequency of the pattern, :math:`N\leq f_P\leq 100\cdot N`

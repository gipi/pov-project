Wheel
=====

The geometry of the wheel is obviously circular, from `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle_wheel#Sizes>`_ we know that
the denomination of the wheels has the pattern::

    <width inflated tire>-<rim's inner width>

In our test we used one with designation ``22-622`` so that the radius of the wheel is 330mm
